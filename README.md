# Replication of Imai, Horiuchi & Taniguchi (2007 AJPS)

This repository contains my replication work of:

**Horiuchi, Yusaku, Kosuke Imai, and Naoko Taniguchi (2007).  
"Designing and Analyzing Randomized Experiments: Application to a Japanese Election Survey Experiment."  
American Journal of Political Science, 51(3): 669–687.**

---

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this project is to **systematically replicate** the tables and figures in the AJPS 2007 article and extend the analysis with additional robustness checks and subgroup analyses.

---

## 📂 Contents
- `week1_report.Rmd`: R Markdown document replicating Tables 2, 3, and Figure 3.  
- `week1_report.html`: Compiled HTML output of the replication report.  
- `data/`: Includes original replication data and R scripts (`table.R`, `table2.R`, `figure3.R`).  
- `.gitignore`: Ensures only relevant replication files are tracked.  

---

## ✅ Progress
- Successfully reproduced:
  - **Table 2** (ITT and CACE estimates)  
  - **Table 3** (subgroup analyses)  
  - **Figure 3** (heterogeneous treatment effects)  
- Organized outputs in both `.Rmd` and `.html` formats for reproducibility.

---

## 🔜 Next Steps
- Replicate **appendix tables and robustness checks**.  
- Conduct additional **subgroup analyses** beyond the published ones.  
- Compare with alternative model specifications.  
- Document challenges and solutions in replication (e.g., differences in random seeds, package updates).
